# Background

The twin shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the Myanmar coup in early 2021 forced a suspension of in-person agricultural advisory services and drove up the cost of commercial fertilizers and pesticides. I saw this as an opportunity to shift from in-person to digital farm practices, leveraging the growth of social media. I pitched the idea to senior management. When it was accepted, I immersed myself with the Digital Marketing, Contact Center, Product & Service Design, Agronomy, and Digital Initiative to integrate ideas and domain knowledge from these diverse teams to design and provide timely and cost-effective farming advice directly to farmersâ€™ smartphones. We pivoted to digital campaigns on Facebook and Facebook Messenger to promote lower cost, accessible, and sustainable homemade organic inputs. To date, Tthis collaborative effort resulted in enhancing the accessibility of sustainable farming practices, weather and market information for 2 million farmers. This project also granted me opportunities to utilize my expertise to harness data and analytics with new farming technologies as proactive measures to stem the tide of farming disasters. Watching the impacts of farmers having access to this information, improving their crop quality and yields, motivates my teammates and me. Most importantly, it demonstrates how collective actions are helping to build a more vital agriculture industry - one farmer at a time.

> The project aims to create a comprehensive data ecosystem for this solution AgronomyBot, which includes developing ETL workflows, a data repository, a dashboard, and SOPs for maintaining the workflow and dashboard. As part of the project, an audit of the existing data structure will be conducted, and a new template will be recommended to integrate data from multiple sources. The ideal outcome of this project is to meets Organization Objective on Develop strong data-driven business decision making culture and systems that can contribite to Organization Mission and Strategies.

### Analytical Approach

![](./Diagrams/Prescriptive_Analytics.png)


# Target Setting

![](./Diagrams/4_Improved_Adopter_driven_data_model_.png)

> "Setting campaign targets can be a complex task, considering various factors such as crops, seasonality, region, precipitation, and soil health. However, we strive to overcome these challenges by leveraging our analysis of historical data to establish reference rates. This enables us to identify and celebrate specific farming practices at the optimal timing, ultimately delivering smartphones to farmers in a smart and efficient manner."

# Data modelling
I use pre-aggregated data for this portfolio project. It helps me reduce the amount of data and sensitive information that needs to be processed for analyses or reporting. It involves summarizing or grouping data at a higher level of granularity, such as by week or month, instead of processing every individual record. I use THREE pre-aggregation methods:

- Summarizing data by time intervals (daily basics)
- Aggregating data by categories (less granularity in dimension data)
- Filtering data to exclude irrelevant records (omit sensitive information)
- Simulating data based to display similar trends and patterns (not actual figures)
